                            <p class="features-description-2">In an increasingly digital world, the role of architecture is becoming increasingly important. From designing structures and buildings to mapping out cities and towns, architects are playing a growing role in shaping our world. But why? Architecture touches almost every aspect of our lives — from the home we live to the offices we work in and the cafes where we socialize with friends. The importance of architecture goes beyond aesthetics; it affects how we live, learn and collaborate with others. Architecture has a positive effect on our physical, mental and emotional health as well as our general wellbeing. In this blog post, we explore some of the reasons why architecture is vital to our lives.</p>

                        <p class="item-description" >Digital design software is crucial in the modern architecture sector. Clients expect to see more than concept drawings, blueprints, and physical models. They want to see virtual representations that offer more detail. With 3D modelling, you can design interiors and populate your buildings. With some, you can even adjust lighting effects and account for how external forces will affect a building.</p>
